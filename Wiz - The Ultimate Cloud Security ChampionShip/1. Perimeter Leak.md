# Perimeter Leak

## Objective:
After weeks of exploits and privilege escalation you've gained access to what you hope is the final server that you can then use to extract out the secret flag from an S3 bucket.
It won't be easy though. The target uses an AWS data perimeter to restrict access to the bucket contents.
Good luck!
