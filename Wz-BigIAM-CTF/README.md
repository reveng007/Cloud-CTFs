The challenges were totally based on scenarios where you would be given different IAM roles to assume and have to perform attack based on:

1. Misconfigured Simple Query Service (sqs)
2. Overly permissive S3 bucket Resource policy
3. Overly permissive AWS SNS Subscription Endpoint
4. Misconfigured AWS IDP (Cognito)
